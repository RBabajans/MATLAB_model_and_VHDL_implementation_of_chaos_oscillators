# MATLAB_model_and_VHDL_implementation_of_chaos_oscillators
This repository contains MATLAB models and VHDL fixed-point arithmetic implementations of several chaos oscillators.

Currently the implemented oscillators are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item List entries start with the \verb|\item| command.
  \item Individual entries are indicated with a black dot, a so-called bullet.
  \item The text in the entries may be of any length.
\end{itemize}
